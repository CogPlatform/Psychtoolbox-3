function BasicSoundScheduleDemo(wavfilenames, device)
% BasicSoundScheduleDemo([wavfilenames][, device])
%
% This demo shows two things:
%
% - How to use audio schedules in PsychPortAudio to preprogram a sequence
% of different sounds to play and how to dynamically add new sounds to the
% schedule while it is playing. This is similar to "playlists" in typical
% audio player applications like iTunes or the iPod etc.
%
% - How to create and use many prefilled audio buffers before start of a
% session. This way you can preload all needed sounds before start of an
% experiment into memory, in a format optimized for fast playback and low
% memory usage. This is similar to the concept of textures or offscreen
% windows in the domain of Screen() for the visuals.
%
% Optional arguments:
%
% wavfilenames = Name of a .wav sound file to load and play back, or a cell
% array with multiple filenames to load. Otherwise the default sound files
% provided with Psychtoolbox will be loaded.
%
% device = Device index of the sound card to use.
%
%
% The demo first loads all soundfiles, and resamples them to identical
% samplingrate if possible. Then it plays the first second of each of them.
% Then it goes into an interactive mode: By pressing any of the F1 - F10
% keys or any letter key, you can select a specific file for playback. By
% pressing any other key you exit the interactive loop. After the
% interactive loop has finished, a subset of the soundfiles is played again
% with a different method, for about 2 repetitions. Then the demo exits.

% Enable use of sound schedules: We create a schedule of default size,
% currently 128 slots by default. From now on, the driver will not play
% back the sounds stored via PsychPortAudio('FillBuffer') anymore. Instead
% you'll have to define a "playlist" or schedule via subsequent calls to
% PsychPortAudio('AddToSchedule'). Then the driver will process that
% schedule by playing all defined sounds in the schedule, one after each
% other, until the end of the schedule is reached. You can add new items to
% the schedule while the schedule is already playing.

% Start audio playback of the defined schedule. We don't spec the
% 'repetitions' parameter, as this parameter is ignored when using sound
% schedules. To repeat a schedule, you must refill it in time with new
% slots or select its size so it auto-repeats properly. Why this restriction?
% As a safety measure against programming errors. Without this, it would be
% easy to create infinite playback loops due to small programming mistakes,
% where you can't exit sond playback anymore and have to kill Matlab/Octave
% just to get your system back. This restriction may be lifted in future
% driver releases if we find a good way to implement some child-protection.
